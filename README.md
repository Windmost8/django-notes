# Models
## Creating Models
+ models.Model is class, by django.all model classes  inhereit models.model. W
+ When we create the models, they becomes tables in the database. 
+ Every field is a coloumn. 
+ every object is a row. 



## Model Fields
+ For any model we create, django adds a field called ID, and this ID is the primary key. Therfore its unique and never repeated, and its used whenever for creating relationships between two models. ex... 
Product.objects.get(pk=1)
Category.objects.get(id=1)

+ If a model wants to have a field from another model, then a foreign key is needed to connect them. The primary is the one that 

+ default = when a new object is created, and this is not assigned a value, default is what will be assigned. ex
...
description = models.CharField(max_length=250, blank=True, default='generic description')

+ null = True means that a field can be empty. ex
...
category = models.ForeignKey("Category", on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True, default=1)

+ . CASCADE, RESTRICT, SET_NULL. cascade would delete all associated items with the foreign key, restrict would stop you from deleting a foreign key if there WAS something associated with it, and set null removes the whole thing.

# Query & Database
+ Product.objects.all() returns all items inside Product
Product.objects.get(name="billy") returns Product item with the name billy. Note: get returns 1 result, if you want more than one, use filter()
p = Product.objects.get(name="billy") and then p.save() will save it to the database. Note. a typo will not result in an error, but you will not get your desired result.

# ManyToMany
+ You can "add" via the same line, or do it seperately.
o1.products.add
o1.products.add(Product.objects.get(name="Ã¥sa"), Product.objects.get(name="bob marley"))

+ You cannot do a .attribute to a Class/Model, but rather to an object. So for example 
c = Category() and then c.name
You cannot do Category.name

+ Realize closely what is the object, and what is the Class. For your own sake, maybe name objects more clearer. 

+ User is an inbuilt django Model, that is not shown but is there. You can check the fields in the admin page. 

+ https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/db/queries/#saving-foreignkey-and-manytomanyfield-fields

+ .create() saves auatomatically instead of having to do .save()

+ Foreignkeys and manttomany fields cannot be assinged values, you must either .get() or .create(). The rest can, on the same line too.

# Query

+ Product.objects.create(name="sameh", price=4, category=Category.objects.create(name="pop"))

+ There are two ways to filter, one standard, and one shorthand. Both achieve the same thing in this example;
Product.objects.filter(category=Category.objects.get(name="Reggae")) - normal
Product.objects.filter(category__name="Reggae") - shorthand

+ You can use a greater than or lesser than operator in filter like this
Product.objects.filter(price__gte=1000)
Product.objects.filter(price__lte=10)
NOTE: that the position of the operator in the code doesnt neccessarily mean anything. Product.objects.filter(category__name="Reggae"), in this example, name is a field, not an operator.
